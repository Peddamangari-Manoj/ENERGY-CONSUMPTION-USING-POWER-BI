📊 ENERGY CONSUMPTION USING POWER BI — PROJECT OVERVIEW
If you're planning a Power BI project on energy consumption, here's a structured approach to help you execute and present it effectively.

🧩 1. Project Objective
To analyze, visualize, and gain insights from energy consumption data using Power BI. The goal is to:

Identify high-consumption areas.

Understand usage patterns over time.

Support energy-saving decisions.

📦 2. Data Requirements
You'll need datasets like:

Energy consumption (kWh) over time.

Source types (Electricity, Solar, Gas, etc.).

Time dimension (Hourly, Daily, Monthly).

Location data (City, Region, Building).

Optional: Temperature/weather, cost of energy, appliance-level data.

Example sources:

IoT devices (sensors/meters).

Government portals (e.g., data.gov.in, data.world).

Energy providers.

🏗️ 3. Data Modeling
In Power BI:

Create a Star Schema:

Fact table: Energy_Consumption

Dimension tables: Date, Location, Source, Device, etc.

Create relationships (1:*).

🧮 4. Key Metrics (DAX)
Total Consumption = SUM(Energy_Consumption[kWh])

Average Daily Usage = AVERAGEX(DATES, [Total Consumption])

Peak Load Time = MAX(Energy_Consumption[Time])

% Renewable Usage = (SUM(Renewable) / SUM(Total))*100

📈 5. Visualizations
Visual Type	Purpose
Line Chart	Trend of energy usage over time
Bar Chart	Compare consumption across locations/devices
Pie/Donut Chart	Energy source distribution
Map	Geographic consumption heatmap
KPI Cards	Key metrics like total usage, peak load
Slicers	Filter by date, region, source

📊 6. Dashboard Features
Interactive filters: Region, time period, source.

Drill-down: From yearly > monthly > daily view.

Alerts: High usage detection.

Forecasting: Power BI built-in forecast for trends.

📝 7. Conclusion / Insights
Example:

Weekends show lower consumption.

Renewable energy accounts for 25% of total use.

Office buildings in Hyderabad consume the most energy.

Opportunity: Install solar panels in high-usage zones.

📄 8. Possible Enhancements
Integrate real-time IoT data using Azure Stream Analytics.

Include billing/cost data for financial insights.

Machine learning: Forecast future usage using Azure ML.
